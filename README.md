A simple Rust app for creating music.

## Authors

- Hubert Wasilewski @hubertwas
- Kamil Szymczak @kamilszymczak1

## How to use

For now, we can define out music in the `main.rs` file. Once we want to actually listen to it,
we just have to do `cargo run` and listen to the `audio.wav` file that's been produced.

## Goals for the project

- Implement an interpreter so that we can define music in a custom language, not in Rust source code,
- Make the interpreter read live changes to a file and change the music according to them,
- Include multiple different sounds, samples, effects, and instruments,
- Allow multiple people to collaborate on the same music project at the same time
